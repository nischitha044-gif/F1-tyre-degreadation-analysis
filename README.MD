# F1 Tyre Degradation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes tyre degradation patterns in Formula 1 races using historical lap time data. 
This project is being built step by step as I learn GitHub and data analysis.

The goal is to understand how lap times increase as tyres wear and to identify potential pit stop windows.

## Objective
- Analyze lap time degradation across race stints
- Compare performance trends over laps
- Identify the lap where performance drop-off becomes significant

## Dataset
- Historical Formula 1 race lap time data
- Publicly available motorsport datasets

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Lap time vs lap number analysis
- Visualization of degradation trends
- Basic statistical interpretation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Questions
- How quickly do lap times degrade over a stint?
- When does tyre performance significantly drop?
- What insights can support pit stop strategy?

## Status
Project in progress
